# 🎨 The Creative Studio: Art & Code Journey

Welcome to my digital atelier! This project is a personal landing page for my YouTube channel, designed to showcase the intersection of my three biggest passions: **Art, Academics, and Programming.**

## 🌟 The Vision
I created this space to show that being a student doesn't mean you have to stop being a creator. My vision is to balance my school studies with my artistic growth. This website serves as a gallery for my creative spirit and a milestone in my journey as a self-taught coder.

## 🚀 Built With
This page was handcrafted by me to practice my front-end development skills:
* **HTML5** - For the structure and storytelling.
* **CSS3** - For the "Classy Light" aesthetic, glassmorphism effects, and responsive layout.
* **Passion** - For the art and the code!

## 📸 Preview
> [!TIP]
> This site features a minimalist, professional "Light Mode" design to keep the focus on the content and maintain a high-end gallery feel.

## 📚 What I’m Learning
* **Art:** Mastering color theory and digital sketching.
* **Code:** Moving from basic HTML/CSS to more interactive designs.
